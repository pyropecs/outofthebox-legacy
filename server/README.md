# OUT OF THE BOX

**a full stack app using MERN that makes person share their own stories**

login page logic
first we have to check user exist or not id not exist .if user not exist we have redirect to sign ip page or else.if user authenticated we must true or false .if it true that we have to redirect to the new page or else me must throw to our form that user not exist .and redirecting to sign up page quite annoying for users because they mispelled it so we have to just make sure only throw an error not redirect

next plan validation the blogs
